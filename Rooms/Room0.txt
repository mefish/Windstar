You awake, naked on the floor in a pool of cold fluid.  The tiled floor is freezing.  The room is dark except for red, green, and blue status lights blinking like eyes.  An emergency sign spills red light across sparkling pieces of glass on the floor, and the room reeks of chemicals.  You stand up on shaky legs.
