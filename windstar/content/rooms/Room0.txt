You awake and look at the room around you with blurry eyes.  Your head is fuzzy, and as it and your vision clears you find yourself in a dark laboratory.  A metal pan sits on a stand next to you, various surgical instruments strewn across its surface.  You're strapped in a chair, nylon straps around your wrists and ankles.  In front of you lies a dead body covered in lacerations.  Blood leaks into a pool on the floor.  A thick door is in front of you, a red exit light glowing dully in the dark.  Somewhere behind you an emergency light spins, illuminating screens that are shut off, and a large robotic arm poised above you.  A computer sits in the corner with a blue log in screen glowing brightly.
